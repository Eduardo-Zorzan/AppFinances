This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project is a college assignment focused on creating a finance management app. The app was built using Next.js with TypeScript and SQL Server as the database. The frontend was designed specifically for mobile, given that the majority of internet access today is through mobile devices. Due to time constraints, I couldn't complete the "Investments" section before the assignment deadline.
To run the app, first download the dependencies, then enter npm run dev in the terminal. Since the app is designed only for mobile, enable mobile view in your browser's developer tools.
Thank you for visiting my repository! Feel free to suggest improvements or point out any errors in the code.
